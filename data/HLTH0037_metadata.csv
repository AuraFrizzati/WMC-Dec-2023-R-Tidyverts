"hlth0037","Summary information","General description","The data presented in this table is for contextual purposes only as it does not include attendances for some minor injuries units in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board, where patient-level data cannot be obtained on a consistent basis as all other hospitals. Therefore the total number of attendances will be lower than those presented in the NHS Activity and Performance statistical release and associated StatsWales tables, as attendances in these publications are based on aggregated data that is collected from all hospitals. 
A widened scope of emergency department performance statistics are now published on the National Collaborative Commissioning Unit (NCCU) website, as management. This includes measures on the time from patient arrival to triage, the time from patient arrival to contact with a clinical decision maker and analysis of the patient’s discharge destination when they leave the emergency department. These will be updated every month on the same day as this National Statistics publication.
Data Prior to January 2013 will not be directly comparable with data for January 2013 onwards due to a change in methodology. See notes in March 2013 release for more details (January 2013).
While there are some small numbers in the data collected and presented, the information is not considered to be sensitive in nature and there is no identifying information presented.","hlth0037","000000025617","2023-10-19T06:52:48.5511229Z","W/""datetime'2023-10-19T06%3A52%3A48.5511229Z'"""

"hlth0037","Summary information","Revisions information","On a monthly basis, LHBs can resubmit data to DHCW if they have carried further validation during the month and they need to revise their data.
A change to reporting guidance led to the inconsistent implementation of a data standard change notice across health boards in Wales between March 2021 and October 2021. As a result the data previously published for both the 4 and 12 hour targets, for these months was not based on a consistent 'clock stop' definition across Wales. As of December 2021, these data have been revised and data for all health boards is now published using the same ‘clock stop’ definition.
The revisions are primarily based on resubmitted data from Aneurin Bevan health board. The changes to the previously published data at the national level and Aneurin Bevan health board level are summarised in the tables below.
The number of attendances at emergency departments is unaffected, more information can be found in the statistical release.","hlth0037","000000025623","2023-10-19T06:52:48.5511229Z","W/""datetime'2023-10-19T06%3A52%3A48.5511229Z'"""
